# Visualization of Linear Regression for digit identification

If we could extract the different segments of the digit like a 7-segment clock (e.g. gymnasium ones), then a linear regression could do the trick.

To convince yourself of that, try it out yourself! [Click on this link](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/Louis-Bagot/Teaching/blob/main/Deep_Learning/visu_segments/neural_net_segments.html) to visualize the html in this folder. Once you see the neural network, you can do the following operations:
- click on a single link to change its value. As a starting point, play around with just +1 and -1 values
- click on a digit to change the values of all the weights leading to it. 
- click on "Evaluate Loss" to see how good your solution is. Take a few minutes to try and come up with the best loss you can! Let's see who in the class can make it fall the lowest.
